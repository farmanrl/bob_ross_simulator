# Bob Ross Simulation Proposal

Our goal is to make a program capable of simulating the generation of paintings
based on those of the esteemed Bob Ross. Our simulation will be composed of
four distinct sections:

1. Reading the data and creating a Markov chain (the model) that accords with that data

2. Use that Markov chain to generate a set of elements which will appear in the
painting

3. Use that set of elements to create an image that contains stock pictures
corresponding to those elements

4. Use that image in conjuction with a deep convolutional generative adverserial
neural network (DCGANN) to generate an image in the style of the ever-esteemed
Bob Ross' artwork

The creation of and theory behind the Markov chain in step one consitutes our
model for the purposes of this class.
